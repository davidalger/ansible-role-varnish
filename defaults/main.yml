# Instance configuration

# See man page for details on named instances. Also used for file suffixing;
# example: varnish.params will be deployed as varnish{{ varnish_service_suffix }}.params
#
varnish_instance:
  # name: data                # this is optional; if specified, varnish-data service will be configured

  backend_port: 8080
  backend_host: localhost     # this is optional; defaults to localhost if unspecified

## Listener settings

# Default address to bind to. Blank address means all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, otherwise specify a host name,
# an IPv4 dotted quad, or an IPv6 address in brackets.

## VCL config

# Default varnish instance configuration template
varnish_vcl_template: magento2.vcl.j2

# Backend reponse ttl in seconds
varnish_beresp_ttl: 86400

# Health check URI (pass health check requests such as /health_check.php and /health.php)
varnish_health_check: "^/(pub/)?(health_check.php|health.php)$"

# List of hosts used in the vcl template perge acl
varnish_acl_purge_hosts: ["localhost"]

# Array of hosts used in profile acl; supports use of Blackfire profiling when needed
#
# At minimum this should both include "localhost" when varnish resides behind nginx or another
# similar proxy on the same server and the actual client IPs which should be allowed to bust
# through varnish when profiling. When set, the appropriate VCL code will be included (assuming
# use of default VCL template) and requests where client.ip and X-Real-IP are BOTH on the list
# of allowed IPs will be allowed through. All other requests with a X-Blackfire-Query header
# will be denied.

varnish_max_threads: 1000

# Value for workspace_backend must be larger than both http_resp_hdr_len and http_resp_size. These settings must be

# Value for workspace_client must be larger than both varnish_http_req_size and varnish_http_req_size. These settings
# may need to be raised on large-catalog sites where PURGE requests to varnish may easily near and/or breach the limits
# with a 1024k+ X-Magento-Tags-Pattern header used for selectively banning items found in the cache.
