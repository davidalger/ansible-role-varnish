# Ansible Role: Varnish Cache

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/davidalger/ansible-role-varnish.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/davidalger/ansible-role-varnish)

Installs [Varnish Cache](https://varnish-cache.org) version 4/5/6 on RHEL / CentOS 8 and 7 and may be used for either single or multi instance configurations where one or more named varnish services are configured on the same server. See package cloud for details on available versions: https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/

This role by default installs a VCL specifically geared towards [Magento 2](https://github.com/magento/magento2), although any VCL may be used by using your own template and setting it's path via the `varnish_vcl_template` variable. With this being the case, other varnish default tuning params are also pre-configured in a manner that more well suits deployment of the Magento 2 application.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

See `defaults/main.yml` for a list of variables available to customize the service.

## Example Usage

* Single varnish instance:

        - { role: davidalger.varnish, tags: varnish }

* Multi varnish instance. With the following configuration, the `varnish` service is disabled and a `varnish-site1` and `varnish-site2` service will be setup.

        - { role: davidalger.varnish, tags: varnish, varnish_instance: { name: site1, port: 6081, admin_port: 6082 }}
        - { role: davidalger.varnish, tags: varnish, varnish_instance: { name: site2, port: 6091, admin_port: 6092 }}
